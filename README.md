# Getting and Cleaning Data

Project from Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

The Repository contains data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip that contains info about exercises movements.

Running the script called run_analysis.R will generate a dataset called tidy.txt that contains the mean and std of the data.
